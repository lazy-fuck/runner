# runner

## Description

Essentially just a visually appealing way to run predefined commands in your terminal of choice.

## Usage

Open the source file and read. It's fairly simply to modify to suit your needs, even if you don't know Perl.

## Dependencies

(Unfortunately) runner depends on the 'Curses' CPAN module, which is a wrapper for the C curses API.
This module is not part of Perl, so you'll have to install it yourself.\

Good luck.
